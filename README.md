# ShinobiWay

ShinobiWay is an interactive iOS application designed to help users learn and perfect Naruto's iconic hand sign techniques. By practicing the correct sequence of gestures under timed conditions and receiving real-time feedback via a CoreML model, users can improve their speed, accuracy, and cognitive agility while immersing themselves in a gamified, anime-inspired experience.

## Overview

## Development Challenges

Due to short notice, I developed ShinobiWay in just 4 days. During this time, I faced several challenges, including:
- Working within Swift Playground packages in Xcode.
- Ensuring the app correctly loads the CoreML model and displays accurate output.
- Reconciling the high (99%) preview accuracy of the model with lower performance in the live app.

These challenges provided a steep learning curve, and I am committed to further refining and enhancing the app in future updates.

## Future Development

- **Enhanced ML Accuracy:** Continuously refine the CoreML model to better capture the nuances of hand signs.
- **Custom Training Programs:** Enable users to create personalized jutsu sequences and practice routines.
- **Social and Competitive Features:** Integrate leaderboards, challenges, and social sharing to build a community of ninja learners.
- **Augmented Reality Integration:** Overlay digital guidance during practice sessions for a more immersive experience.
- **Advanced Sound and Haptic Feedback:** Implement adaptive audio cues and tactile responses based on performance.
- **Localization and Accessibility:** Expand language support and accessibility options for a global audience.
- **Virtual Reality (VR):** Imagine choosing your favorite anime character and battling fellow participants in VR, where your speed, accuracy, and muscle memory translate into thrilling, real-time combatâ€”bringing intellectual, physical, and social benefits to an entirely new level.

## Technologies

- **Swift & SwiftUI:** For a modern, responsive iOS interface.
- **CoreML & Vision:** For real-time hand sign recognition and feedback.
- **AVFoundation:** For camera integration and multimedia management.
- **GitHub:** For version control and collaborative development.
